# Task

Using only single-character output statements that output one of ‘#’, ‘ ’, or ‘\n’ (hash, space, and newline), write a C++ program to produce the following shape. You may not store characters anywhere before outputting them, and you may not use any string related functions.

```
#                 #
 ##             ##
  ###         ###
   ####     ####
    ###########
    ###########
   ####     ####
  ###         ###
 ##             ##
#                 #
```
