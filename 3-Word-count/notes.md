Uppercase or lowercase;

## Testing

1. What if someone presses enter right away? - If no word count then return warning
2. What if there’s only one word? - Count one word
3. What if there are many words? - Use spaces as delimeters
4. What if the user enters a single space? - Counts as no words
5. What if the user ends with a space? - Check to see if the last character is a space before EOL
6. What if there are multiple spaces between words? - check for consecutive spaces and decrement
7. What to do with punctuation?
